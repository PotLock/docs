# ðŸ“ƒ Contracts Overview



## All Contracts

To assure that all projects are coming from the official PotLock team they are deployed as [**subaccounts**](https://docs.near.org/tutorials/crosswords/basics/add-functions-call#create-a-subaccount) under the potlock.near namespace. Testnet and Mainnet follow the same naming conventions to avoid any confusion.&#x20;

### Mainnet ([potlock.near](https://nearblocks.io/address/potlock.near))



### Testnet ([potlock.testnet](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/potlock.testnet))
