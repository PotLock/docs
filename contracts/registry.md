## Overview

The PotLock project registry allow us to query projects that have signed up to our project onboarding which uses contracts like [nearhorizon.near](https://nearblocks.io/address/nearhorizon.near) and [social.near](https://nearblocks.io/address/social.near), but also lets round managers to curate projects to prevent from getting spammed.
