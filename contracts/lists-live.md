* Create your own explore page of Potlock for individuals, corporations, and non-public goods
* Get community signal through upvotes
* Create donate to all flow for lists to easily support a wide basket of project
* Create signal for projects like RetroPGF

## On the [Contract](https://github.com/PotLock/core/tree/main/contracts/lists)

The primary goal of the PotLock Lists Contract is to provide a flexible platform where anyone can create and manage their own lists of accounts (referred to as "registrants"). This functionality is particularly useful for organizing groups, communities, or any collection of Near Protocol accounts based on specific criteria or for specific purposes. The contract supports self-registration by accounts as well as registration management by list owners and admins.

### Contract Structure

#### General Types

* `RegistrantId`: Alias for `AccountId`, representing an account on the list.
* `RegistrationId`: A unique identifier for a registration instance, used to track individual registrations.
* `ListId`: A unique identifier for each list created within the contract.
* `TimestampMs`: Represents time in milliseconds.

#### Contract

The main contract structure (`Contract`) contains several key fields:

* `next_list_id`: Tracks the ID to be assigned to the next list created.
* `next_registration_id`: Tracks the ID to be assigned to the next registration.
* Various mappings to manage lists, registrations, list ownership, list administrators, and registrant relationships.

#### Lists

* **Internal Representation**: `ListInternal` includes details such as name, description, cover image URL, owner, creation and update timestamps, and registration status management.
* **External View**: `ListExternal` is used for external queries, including additional details like total registration and upvote counts.

#### Registrations

Defines the status of registrations (`RegistrationStatus`) and structures for managing registration details both internally (`RegistrationInternal`) and externally (`RegistrationExternal`).



**Write Methods**

* **Initialization**: `new` to set up the contract with initial source metadata.
* **List Management**: Methods to create, update, delete lists,  upvotes & remove upvote, and handle ownership and admin rights.
