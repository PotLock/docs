## Overview

The POTLOCK project registry allows us to query projects that have signed up to our project onboarding which uses contracts like [nearhorizon.near](https://nearblocks.io/address/nearhorizon.near) and [social.near](https://nearblocks.io/address/social.near), but also lets round managers curate projects to prevent them from getting spammed.

Setters

* Projects can be only by project addressed or whitelisted owner
  * Recommended using a named account with the project name on it or subject to be added to the graylist
  * All projects that sign up through traditional flow will be put on the whitelist (approved), and admins must trigger a status change to be taken off
* an owner (DAO) can add admins that can add projects manually to the registry or can change the status of the project (put on blacklist or graylist or approve a project)

Getters

* can check whether a project is on the  registry
* can check the status of a projects
* can get the last projects on the whitelist, graylist, and blacklist

What is the difference between a graylist and a blacklist

* graylist is if we are unsure this is a legit project
* blacklist is surely not a legit project, it also may be a personal account, spam, or contain inappropriate content
