Although for direct donations that do not have tax benefits, there is minimal impact if someone is using unique accounts for donations. However, when it comes to democratic voting / funding systems like quadratic funding, we need to make sure that the system is not being gamed and that our subsequent funding contracts are checking for definitions of humans.



We have invented a way for other sybil providers and contracts to develop "checks" or "stamps" if you are familiar with [Gitcoin Passport's](https://passport.gitcoin.co/) model.&#x20;
