# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è BOS Gateway + Workspace

[BOS](https://docs.near.org/bos) is a front end React like framework where you can save front end JSX code directly on chain (NEAR Protocol) to composable multichain web app experiences.

## BOS Workspace

PotLock bos-app is setup using [BOS Workspace](https://github.com/nearbuilders/bos-workspace).  Make sure to change potlock.near to your respective NEAR account to deploy all the components to when you are forking. The following workspace lets you easily deploy all components into mainnet and hotload local components into the NEAR.org gateway.

Since then we have migrated to an in house framework built by one of our Lead Contributor, Wenderson called [Alem.dev](https://alem.dev)

## Using A Web IDE

This best Web IDE for developing a gateway by far is [jutsu.ai](https://jutsu.ai) . Here you can fork components and even make PRs directly to the original component. without installing external dependencies&#x20;

## Deploy your Own BOS Gateway

If you want to fork our components and  build custom experiences, put under your own domain, and [external dependencies](https://youtu.be/cJuHp8exNVY) to the VM. deploy on BOS gateway, available at [https://bos.potlock.org](ttps://bos.potlock.org)&#x20;

You can easily host your gateway on a service like vercel or fleek.co&#x20;

## TBD

* Still need to setup testnet BOS workspace and components deployed under potlock.testnet&#x20;
