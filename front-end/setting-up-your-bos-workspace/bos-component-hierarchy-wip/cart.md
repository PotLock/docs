## Understand BOS' Storage API

BOS's Storage API allows you to easily take data from different components and save them to a custom type in your browser's local storage without the need for an onchain transaction. We leverage this in our cart to add different donation amounts for both regular donations and Pots so users can streamline their checkout in one flow like they normally would do in a commerce solution.
