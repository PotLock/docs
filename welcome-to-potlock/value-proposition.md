# ðŸš€ Value Proposition

## Reduce Overhead

Reduce overhead for receiving funding and running your own funding programs.&#x20;

## Discover Funding Opportunities

Allow projects to find relevant funding opportunities

## Community Coordination Tools

Enable anyone to fund their project, cause, or individual through trustless, and open source tooling.&#x20;

## Transparency

The more impact you make the higher levels of funding pools you can access. We believe in streamlining all past funding in a central location

## Impact Based Evaluation

Through our attestation framework, we will be enabling those to evaluate impact, curators to rate the quality of the attestation, and for people to give attestation of specific schema types for specific use cases/evaluation frameworks.&#x20;

## First Open Funding Platform&#x20;

Its been years on NEAR and we have yet to a have a quadratic funding platform, or a platform where anyone can funding anything. We aim to revolutionize the culture of external contributions on one of the fasteset and cheapest L1s.&#x20;
