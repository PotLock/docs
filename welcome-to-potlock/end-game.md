# 🐊 End Game

Potlock is a composable and permissionless funding stack currently built on NEAR. As the only and go-to public goods funding platform, we are directly addressing plural funding and impact tracking with the NEAR ecosystem. Most immediately we are going to market to build new funding mechanisms, composable contracts and front ends, and a clean user experience so even your grandma can use it. Our ultimate goal is to proliferate public goods funding by building a new class of tools and ways for people to coordinate driven by mission alignment and regenerative incentives.
