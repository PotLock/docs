A project on POTLOCK represents a public good initiative that contributes value to the wider ecosystem. It serves as your project's digital identity on the platform, showcasing your work, goals, and impact to potential supporters and the community.

## **What Happens When You Create A Project?**

1. **Project Registry Listing** Your project gets added to POTLOCK's Project Registry, a curated collection of public goods initiatives. This makes your project discoverable to donors who are actively looking to support meaningful projects. The registry serves as a central hub where supporters can explore, evaluate, and contribute to various public goods.
2. **NEAR Horizon Integration** Your project automatically gets listed on NEAR Horizon (near.org/horizon), which is NEAR Foundation's Founder Success team's service marketplace. This integration provides additional exposure and connects you with NEAR's ecosystem of resources, potential collaborators, and support services. It's an opportunity to tap into NEAR Foundation's network of founders and experts.
3. **NEAR.social Profile Creation** Creating a project establishes your presence on NEAR.social, making your profile discoverable across all #BOS (Blockchain Operating System) gateways. This expanded visibility helps you:
   * Build your project's social presence
   * Connect with other builders and supporters
   * Engage with the broader NEAR community
   * Share updates and progress across the ecosystem
4. **Future Benefits** As POTLOCK evolves, your project will be positioned to:
   * Participate in the global POTLOCK social feed
   * Streamline applications for future quadratic funding rounds
   * Access new features and opportunities as they're released

## **Who Should Create A Project?**

Projects must meet specific criteria to maintain their listing on POTLOCK:

1. **Public Goods Focus** Your project must qualify as a public good, meaning it provides value that is:
   * Non-excludable: Benefits are available to everyone
   * Non-rivalrous: One person's use doesn't reduce availability to others
   * Contributing to the common good of the ecosystem
2. **Code of Conduct Compliance** Projects must adhere to POTLOCK's code of conduct, which includes:
   * Maintaining ethical practices
   * Being transparent about operations
   * Engaging respectfully with the community
   * Following platform guidelines
3. **Guidelines Adherence** Detailed guidelines for what constitutes a public good can be found at [https://potlock.io/project-guidelines](https://potlock.io/project-guidelines). Projects should review these guidelines to ensure alignment before creating their profile.
