Go to Potlock's explore page and find the profile image icon in the top right corner. Click on it and select "My Projects" from the dropdown menu. This will take you to a new page where you can begin creating your project profile. If you already have data for your organization's profile on NEAR.social, the system will automatically pull this information to save you time. If not, you'll need to set up your profile by adding a bio, uploading a profile image and banner, and including relevant tags to help others find your project through global profile searches.

## **Project Details**

1. **Project Title** Your project title should be clear and recognizable. This is the name that will appear across the platform and how others will identify your project.
2. **Project Description** Write a comprehensive overview of your project. Explain what problems you're solving, how your project works, and what makes it unique. Be specific and clear about your project's goals and current status. This is your opportunity to help others understand the value and purpose of your work.
3. **Category Selection** Choose the categories that best represent your project's focus areas. Categories help potential supporters find your project and understand its primary domains. You can select multiple categories if your project spans different areas.
4. **Public Good Statement** Provide a detailed explanation of why your project qualifies as a public good. Describe how your project benefits the wider community, its accessibility, and its contribution to the ecosystem. This statement helps validators and supporters understand your project's impact.
5. **Technical Information**
   * **Smart Contract**: If your project has deployed smart contracts, include their addresses. This adds transparency and allows others to verify your project's on-chain presence.
   * **External Funding**: Disclose any funding your project has received from other sources. This includes grants, investments, or other forms of financial support. Transparency about funding helps build trust.
   * **GitHub Repository**: Share your project's GitHub repository link. This allows others to review your code, contribute, and verify your project's development activity.
6. **Social Links** Add links to your project's social media accounts and community channels. This could include Twitter, Discord, Telegram, or other platforms where you engage with your community. Active social presence helps build credibility and allows supporters to connect with your project.

## **Final Steps**

Once you've filled in all the required information, review everything carefully. Click the submit button to create your project. You'll need to sign a transaction using your connected wallet to confirm the submission. This transaction records your project creation on-chain.

We only support public goods otherwise you will get take off of the [Potlock registry](../../contracts/registry-deprecated.md). Additionally a violation of our [code of conduct](../../general-information/code-of-conduct/) can also get you taken off the Potlock registry.
