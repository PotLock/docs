how to apply to a pot as a project
{% endembed %}

### 1. Get a Project NEAR Account

To begin, projects need to create a NEAR account, preferably using a named account that represents their organization (e.g., POTLOCK.near). It is recommended to have at least 1 NEAR (approximately $2-$4 depending on market rates) to save their on-chain profile and perform other necessary actions. If the project is new to the NEAR ecosystem, they can use a keypom.xyz link with 1 NEAR or create an account at [Meteor Wallet](https://wallet.meteorwallet.app/wallet) and request a transfer of funds. For support with this process, projects can join the [Potlock Community](https://potlock.org/community), where assistance with onboarding fees will be provided.

### 2. Apply to Project Registry

Next, projects must create a profile on POTLOCK by filling out necessary information such as past funding and team details. Instructions for creating a project can be found in the [Potlock documentation](https://docs.potlock.io/user-guides/create-your-project).

### 3. Get Accepted to Project Registry

Currently, projects will be pending approval in the registry and must be accepted by a POTLOCK admin. To expedite the process, projects should notify the POTLOCK core team in the ‚Äúnew-project-registration‚Äù channel on Telegram, providing the link to their project. The status of their application will be indicated without a banner if approved.

### 4. Apply During Application Period

Once accepted, projects must visit the pot during the application period and submit their application.

### Important Note on Donations

**Direct donations are not considered matched donations through pots.** Ensure that matched donations come from individuals who meet nada.bot requirements and are processed through the pot rather than directly via the project page. Projects may mistakenly believe that direct donations through their page are matched donations. While projects receive donations immediately, these are not stored on contract but tracked solely for calculating matching amounts from pools at the end.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Confusing parts: they may think that direct donations via project page are matched donations.

{% hint style="info" %}
DIRECT DONATIONS are not DONATIONS through Pots. Make sure that matched donations are by people who meet nada.bot requirements and its done through the pot and not through the project page.\

{% endhint %}

## Be on the POTLOCK Registry

{% content-ref url="../projects/" %}
[projects](../projects/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Will need to be approved from pending. Join the [Potlock Community telegram](https://potlock.org/community) to let the admins know to check (they should check every other day)
{% endhint %}

## Go Back to Pot & Apply

Go back to pot and click apply. Then give the reason as to why you qualify for this Pot.



## Get Approved

After you are approved you need to rally more of your supports to donate when the matching round is live, to get more of the pool. You can check the "applications" tab of the pot to see if you are approved, or check the projects section.



## Get Others To Donate to You

Advertise on social media and send instructions to your community about what quadratic funding is and how to donate once matching round is live. Even before the matching round is started, it is recommended that donors verify as a human to prevent any friction points.
