# âž• Create Your Project

## What Happens When You Create A Project

* Get Added to Our Project Registry for donors to explore
* Get added to NEAR Horizon (NEAR Foundation's Founder Success team) Service marketplace (near.org/horizon)
* Create a [NEAR.social](https://near.social) profile (and have you profile discoverable to follow) across all #BOS gateways&#x20;
* In the future: streamline into our global potlock social feed and ease application to future quadratic funding rounds.&#x20;

## How To Create A Project

Any public good can create a project.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**Note: it is important to that you should only create a project to a named account someone with financial decision power as funds will be going directly to this account & will be used for future rounds . Soon will be able to register as a proejct as a DAO.**_&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To get a named account go to. It will cost approximately 0.05 N - 0.08 N. If you need a linkdrop in order to cover these costs, hop on the NEAR Impact telegram ([https://nearimpact.org/telegram](https://nearimpact.org/telegram)) to receive funds from one of our ecosystem stewards.&#x20;

If you already have data for your organization's profile on NEAR.social, it will automatically pull this information. If not, please put a bio, profile image, banner, tags (for global profile search), select 1 category.&#x20;



Currently you can only choose 1 category. Only choose public good if you do not fall under one category

{% hint style="warning" %}
Based on #BOS if you are using a non-web wallet like Meteor Wallet, than after you create a profile than nothing will change. It is important to go back to the explore page to check if your project has been successfully created.&#x20;
