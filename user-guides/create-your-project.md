# âž• Create Your Project

## What Happens When You Create A Project

* Get Added to Our Project Registry for donors to explore
* Get added to NEAR Horizon (NEAR Foundation's Founder Success team) Service marketplace (near.org/horizon)
* Create a [NEAR.social](https://near.social) profile (and have you profile discoverable to follow) across all #BOS gateways&#x20;
* In the future: streamline into our global potlock social feed and ease application to future quadratic funding rounds.&#x20;

## How To Create A Project

Any public good can create a project.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**Note: it is important to that you should only create a project to a named account someone with financial decision power as funds will be going directly to this account & will be used for future rounds . Soon will be able to register as a proejct as a DAO.**_&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To get a named account go to. It will cost approximately 0.05 N - 0.08 N. If you need a linkdrop in order to cover these costs, hop on the NEAR Impact telegram ([https://nearimpact.org/telegram](https://nearimpact.org/telegram)) to receive funds from one of our ecosystem stewards.&#x20;

If you already have data for your organization's profile on NEAR.social, it will automatically pull this information. If not, please put a bio, profile image, banner, tags (for global profile search), select 1 category.&#x20;



Currently you can only choose 1 category. Only choose public good if you do not fall under one category

## Who Should Create A Project

We only support public goods otherwise you will get take off of the [Potlock registry](../contracts/registry-live.md). Additionally a violation of our [code of conduct](../general-information/code-of-conduct.md) can also get you taken off the Potlock registry.

## Create A Project As A DAO



Some of you might be managing your on chain organization as a DAO, most notably on near as a Sputnik-DAO through a BOS interface and you donations and rewards to directly go to your DAO treasury.



In order to make a proposal to register as a DAO, it is the normal create project flow, however..... you click check the box.



Note this will also propose to sign up your DAO into NEAR Horizon's project registyr, and update your DAO profile. _**While currently this is in 3 seperate proposals, we are wroking to get i into multicall proposal.** You can only propose a DAO to register to Potlock if the account you are submitting the proposal from all has the ability to propose function calls (you can suggest your DAO interacts with other contracts)._



Although a proposal went through, this only means you are proposing. This means a quorum of your DAO's voting body (those who are allowed to vote on functiona call proposals) must vote for the DAO's address to execute.



Here is how a succesfull signed up DAO looks like.
