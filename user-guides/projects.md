## How to Signup

Go to potlock.io/register to register today. You will need at least 1 N to fill out information as you are interacting with our project registry, nearhorizon.near and the social graph so you can list on BOS.



## How to Apply for A Round

In order to be eligible for certain rounds you may need a SBT unless it a "[Dish](../welcome-to-potlock/understanding-pot-sizes.md)" round. However all projects must be approved on the PotLock registry, so please go through the aforementioned signup flow.



## Who Should Control Project Account

* Only Co-Founders should control this account as payouts should be adminstered. Considering that you have a social media account you may want to givee your an account to a social media manager. However this is not reccomendd. A better solution is to configure your twitter account through the [Wormhole widget ](https://near.org/wormhole3.near/widget/Wormhole3.Twitter)to BOS, and use the #BOS to sync tweets. Even then it is recommended you even use[ delegated access through twitter ](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-use-the-delegate-feature)to other individuals for security purposes.
