## Incentives for Chefs

* A set fee for funding rounds



## How to Become a Chef

In order to become a Chef the N[EAR ReFi Council](refi-council.md) needs to vote you into the "chef" role into the DAO.  One of their requirements is. Express interest at https://PotLock.io/chef-up. From the BOS dashboard, the Council will only be able to award propose you a Chef  role if you are a verified human [https://PotLock.io/human ](https://potlock.io/human)



## What If The Chef "Spits in The Food"

Round managers are a huge vector&#x20;

Based on the current design of Potlock their is room for round manager corruption. This includes

* Rejecting application / approving application (get off-chain kick backs)
* Not approving milestones (could leverage projects to approve)
* Not approving in timely fashion

Solutions

* Reputation based system
* ReFI Council is currently able to remove round managers from DAO (which is what the contracts check on round instantiation)
* Rejection of applications are required to put a reason so other round managers can do diligence. Also all rejections to a round are displayed on BOS components so others can learn from how to do better applications but also hold round manager accountable. Additionally round managers and fees they get from round are also transparency
* Chefs will be required to be verified humans

Undesigned solutions

* Council switching who a round manager is after wrong doing or lack of activity.
* Bad actors SBT

Discussion around this can be found [https://github.com/orgs/PotLock/discussions/2](https://github.com/orgs/PotLock/discussions/2)&#x20;

## Compensation for Chefs

* How much time does it take to facilitate a round?
* How long is a round?&#x20;
* How many hours a week?
* How much am I expected to earn for fees?
* Is there any form of retroactive funding
