# üöÄ Project Tips for Success

[Quadratic funding](https://wtfisqf.com) is a great opportunity to get extra funding for your project through the matching pool, but your community‚Äôs donations determine how much of the pool you get, with more unique donors getting you a bigger share of the matching pool. That means you NEED to onboard people to donate to your project.
