# ðŸ§  Planning A Pot

{% hint style="info" %}
Link to Document to Copy:  [https://potlock.org/plan-pot-doc](https://potlock.org/plan-pot-doc)
{% endhint %}

We built [Potlock](https://app.potlock.org) so anyone can deploy their own funding strategies in a permissionless manner. We are pretty excited about the amount of interest weâ€™ve had for those who wanted to run their own quadratic funding rounds. While we previously made a [Chef-training](https://potlock.org/chef-training) document for Pot owners, admins, and chefs on how to use the platform and difficulties associated with running a round; that more applies to the duration of when the round is open. This document focused on off chain activities, actually planning the round, pitching to sponsors, and finding co-organizers leading up to this, as well as collecting data with a retrospective and engaging projects after the pot. \


In this guide we will be showing you

* Round Templates w/ Examples
* Announcing Your Round
* How to Coordinate with Potlock Team
* Template with Pitches and Agreements\


Some outcomes of this document

* You have a clear written plan of when and who your round will be involved
* You have an outreach strategy for reaching out to likely sponsors and projects in your round
* You will have documents to streamline agreements and pitch
* You will have clear communication with Potlock team for any customization and to streamline marketing as well as support for executing

## Round Template

### Context

Before you start a round you need time for planning a round. If you have not raised and gotten soft commits we recommend you space out 2 months. If you have experience raising for hackathons, events, or pitching a grant program this is similar. You usually need a soft commit to actually do a round or deploy. However you can still deploy your pot contract and use this to pool community resources in a more grassroots way.\


In your pitch you need to establish the success of quadratic funding or even explain the concept. At this point you usually have an idea of what the focus of your round can be, maybe you have an idea of projects that are already in the space.

### Pot Brainstorming Exercise

{% hint style="info" %}
Questions to ask yourself before you start \[COPY THIS DOC]&#x20;

[potlock.org/brainstorm-pot](http://potlock.org/brainstorm-pot)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* What impact do you want to make?&#x20;
* Are the donors for this vertical crypto native or native to NEAR? What is the best path for them to board and bring donations? How many are you expecting
* Is there a particular vertical that you want to tackle?
* Who would be the ones likely to fund these type of vertical? Do you have their contact?
* Are there projects already in this ecosystem?
* Who do you have in your community that can run a round or job is already to help those in this ecosystem get funding?
* What are your marketing assets and deliverables?
* What are the requirements for your projects? Should they only be on the public goods registry? Will you need your own registry that you curate and will people allowed to be apply?
* How many projects are you expecting to apply?
* What are the OKRs and ultimate success like that warrant an valuable ROI for sponsors you have in mind?
* What does a successful round look like for you? What can you measure immediately, and what can you track later?
* Do you have necessary funds in wallets to facilitate. Example 4.4 NEAR to deploy pot, 1 NEAR for approvals, rejections and extensions, and 30 NEAR to seed donations and to onboard other wallets? If not, contact Potlock?\

{% hint style="info" %}
Copy the Following Pitch Template [https://potlock.org/pitch-template](https://potlock.org/pitch-template)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Pot Proposal Template

The following document is for you to plan your pot and turn it into a funding proposal. [https://potlock.org/pot-template](https://potlock.org/pot-template)&#x20;

### Frequently Asked Questions?

How do I get a sponsor on the contract?

* You need to get it on-chain via NEAR. Need to onramp and convert. You can do so on the following support exchanges or onramps.&#x20;

What if a sponsor requests and invoice?

* You may already have an invoice software for your organization or use a free [alternative](https://invoice-generator.com/#/1).

What if sponsor requests and agreement?

* Quadratic Funding Round on [Potlock Sponsor Agreement](https://potlock.org/sponsorship-template)

## Securing Sponsorship

Often sponsors want some type of documentation to agree with

{% hint style="info" %}
Sponsorship Agreement template [https://potlock.org/sponsorship-template](https://potlock.org/sponsorship-template)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Make a copy and replace all the highlighted sections, also decide whether they will pay via NEAR directly in quadratic funding round (only supported currency) or you will handle the onramping of the funds.

## Outreach

While you may have projects in mind. Most often you need to personally have outreach with prospective projects that you want in the round. This also gives an opportunity for your team to set up communications and also add them to the cohort chat and provide direct support. Ultimately you want to have projects that are not only.

Be clear about your eligibility requirements. Examples from [Gitcoin Eligibility](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4U3RA-q9ZW\_Mtlz-EiFtj4YZTkPEwebQSKbEZlCfdY/edit#heading=h.kl4qenhpok7z), [General Potlock Public Goods Guidelines](https://potlock.org/project-guidelines), and [NEAR Retroactive Builders Round](https://www.potlock.org/retro-guidelines).

Really envision the type of project you want in your ecosystem, the level of your team, whether estimated funding amount targets on average warrant the caliber team you are looking for, and whether these projects can onboard their community into the ecosystem. Gitcoin has a good example of this [https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/identifying-high-potential-grantees](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/identifying-high-potential-grantees)&#x20;

Tips

* Use hemingway to read at a 3rd grade level
* Get KOLs to amplify the post
* Send article to projects and communities groups to urge them to sign up even after first initial announcements

## Round Communication

This is covered in chef training, but it is absolutely important that you set up communications channels with your entire round like a cohort, and directly with that project's teams. Projects will be actively onboarding users inside of their community and there is a level of customer support. We highly recommend you put in users in the Potlock telegram as we are always checking. We also recommend that projects get in habit of posting weekly updates as post (and on their impact page) so donors can see their growth.&#x20;



## Data Analytics and Reporting For Your Round

Data is essential for your round. You want to automate to understand which projects are receiving donations, whether those projects are also paying fees to the chef, whether they come from existing web3 communities, whether they are donating to other projects. Whether they are newly created accounts, etc. \


We have a data guild at Potlock and here is information on Flipside to get a sense of pot [https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Lordking/potlock-UD3Flm?tabIndex=6](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Lordking/potlock-UD3Flm?tabIndex=6) \

## After Payouts: Creating A Round Retrospective

After a round it is important to write something retroactive. The following is templates for you and your team to reflect on how to improve your round, forms for you to gain feedback from projects that participated in your round.

{% endhint %}

## After A Round

After a round things are not over. We want to follow up with projects. It's important that projects share their experience, we can keep track of the rounds to improve, and pipeline to new funding opportunities, and get projects to continue to attest.&#x20;

* To let them know they get paid. Any possible offramping.&#x20;
* To make sure that donors are attesting
* To have them share on social media via templates. Copy templates at [https://potlock.org/canva](https://potlock.org/canva)&#x20;

Additionally work with the Potlock team to get messaging about overall round, and then get individual projects paid out to share their experience. Have projects copy the graphic templates ([potlock.org/canva](https://potlock.org/canva)) for projects to share about how much donors they had, how much direct donations, and how much matched amount they got.  and what they plan to do for the funds. Encourage them to connect twitter to NEAR.social to make a post so it shows up.&#x20;
