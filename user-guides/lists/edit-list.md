### Choose Your Editing Option

From the options displayed, you can perform several actions:

### Option 1: Edit List Details

* **Access Editing Page**: Click on “Edit List Details.” This will take you to a page where you can modify various aspects of your list.
* **Make Changes**: Here, you can update:
  * **List Name**: Change the title of your list to better reflect its purpose.
  * **Description**: Revise the overview of your list to provide clearer context or updated information.
  * **Permissions**: Adjust who can apply to or manage the list.
* **Transfer Ownership**: If you wish to transfer ownership of the list, this option is also available on this page.

### Option 2: Transfer List Ownership

* **Changing Ownership**: If you need to step down as the owner or transfer ownership to another user:
  * Click on “Edit List Details” and scroll down to find the “Transfer Ownership” section.
  * Enter the recipient’s address (NEAR account ID) and save your changes.
* **Example Scenario**: For instance, if you were previously a vegan and created a list for vegan projects but now wish to withdraw from that community, transferring ownership allows someone else to take over while you become an ordinary member or administrator.

### Option 3: Add/Remove Accounts (Projects)

* **Manage Project Membership**: Click on “Add/Remove Account.” This feature allows you to manage which projects are included in your list.
* **Select Accounts**: Choose the account(s) (projects) you want to remove from the list.
* **Remove Selected Accounts**: After making your selections, click “Remove Selected Accounts” and submit your changes.

### Option 4: Delete List

*   **Permanently Remove Your List**: If you decide that you no longer need the list:

    Click on “Delete List.”

    You will be prompted to confirm this action. To proceed, click “Yes, I do.” This action is irreversible, so ensure that you truly wish to delete the list before confirming.
