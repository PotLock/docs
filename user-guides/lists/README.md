# ðŸ“‹ Lists

A List is essentially a collection of projects that are grouped together for specific purposes." Each List can have assigned administrators who manage the projects within it, ensuring that the collection aligns with the goals and values of its contributors. For example, A list titled "Climate Change Mitigation Projects" could be used to curate projects focused on environmental sustainability. This list might then be used as a criterion for a quadratic funding round dedicated to climate change solutions.

### Key Features of Lists:

* **Customizable Collections**: Tailor your List to reflect your interests, initiatives, or community needs by selecting relevant projects and accounts.
* **Collaborative Funding**: List can be used as an eligibility criterion so that Projects within a List can apply for funding or receive donations directly from contributors, fostering a collaborative funding environment.
* **Admin Control**: Lists are managed by designated administrators who oversee project applications and ensure that the collection remains focused and effective.

### Gas Fees

When creating a list, it's important to consider gas fees associated with the deployment:

* **Base Fee**: The base fee for creating a list is 300 Tgas.
*

    * **Deposit Calculation**: You will also need to deposit 0.021 NEAR multiplied by the number of accounts added to the list.
      *   **Example**: If you have 5 accounts in the list during creation, the calculation would be:

          $$
          0.021 NEARÃ—5=0.105 NEAR0.021 NEARÃ—5=0.105 NEAR
          $$

    This ensures that there are sufficient funds for transaction fees related to managing the list.
