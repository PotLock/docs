## FAQ

<details>

<summary>How do I know how much of the pool my donation will be matched by?</summary>

**YOU WILL NOT KNOW TILL THE END OF ROUND.** Although we can provide estimates, this is ultimately calculated at the end by every donation via Quadratic funding. So its not just your donation, but your donation and the amount in relation to other unique donors to their amount across all projects. To get more matched to your proejct get other people to support with unique donations.

<summary>Can I earn through my referral link for donations.</summary>

Yes, if someone donates through your referral link you will earn the amount specific in public round for donations in Pot settings. You can also gain referrals to sponsorships to increase the whole pot (as well as direct donations to project). You must make sure you accountId is in refferrerId of the url.
