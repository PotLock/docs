## FAQ

<details>

<summary>How do I know how much of the pool my donation will be matched by?</summary>

**YOU WILL NOT KNOW TILL THE END OF ROUND.** Although we can provide estimates, this is ultimately calculated at the end by every donation via Quadratic funding. So its not just your donation, but your donation and the amount in relation to other unique donors to their amount across all projects. To get more matched to your proejct get other people to support with unique donations.
