## FAQ

<details>

<summary>How do I know how much of the pool my donation will be matched by?</summary>

**YOU WILL NOT KNOW TILL THE END OF ROUND.** Although we can provide estimates, this is ultimately calculated at the end by every donation via Quadratic funding. So its not just your donation, but your donation and the amount in relation to other unique donors to their amount across all projects. To get more matched to your project get other people to support with unique donations. Note that there can be a judges weight which only looks at QF as a factor. Moreover, there are [additional QF rules](../general-information/code-of-conduct/qf-rules.md)

## Supporting Donors

Biggest challenges with donors. To get matched donations there are currently hurdles for donors.&#x20;

**Wallet Creation:** Donors need to create a wallet (preferably a named account) and have NEAR to pay for transactions and stamps to verify their identity as human. It is advisable to allocate at least 0.5 NEAR (approximately $2) for this purpose. Users must also save their private keys

**On-Ramping:** This means they will need to use an on-ramp (click here for available on-ramp options). An alternative is to create a Keypom linkdrop where you preload NEAR for someone to use.

**Nada.bot Verifications:** To receive a matched donation, donors must verify their identity with nada.bot. This involves signing into the app, going to a third-party provider, verifying with another contract (which requires NEAR for the transaction), and then returning to stamp and verify with our contract until they meet the threshold.

### Understanding the Difference Between Direct Donations

Users can directly donate to a project; however, it is essential that they donate through a matched round. Users wonâ€™t know how much will be matched until payouts are completed.
