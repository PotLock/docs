## Raising Matched Donations

### When I Will Receive Payments

All donations come directly to the project. The matching payouts happen after the matching round cool down period. When a matching round is over the pot owner, admin, or chef needs to initiate the calculations & payout transaction. Then their is a cooldown timer for any one to object the calculations. After which the payouts are automated and can be seen in payouts tabs. The funds will be in the wallet of the project account you signed up with.

Donations must be given through the pot section during when matching period is live by people verified as human through nada bot (or whatever the pot requires) to have their donation amplified.

After a round, your project still exists and you will continue to build you reputation.
