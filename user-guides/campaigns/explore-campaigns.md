### Understanding Campaign Phases

The visual indicators on each campaign card help users quickly assess the status of fundraising efforts:

* **Red Indicator**: This signifies that the minimum funding target has not been met. If a campaign remains in this phase, it may risk cancellation.
* **Green Indicator**: This indicates that the campaign goal has been reached successfully. All funds raised will be allocated as intended.
* **Yellow Indicator**: This means that while the minimum target has been satisfied, donations will now pass through to the project and be distributed accordingly. This phase ensures that projects receive necessary funding while still allowing for additional contributions.
