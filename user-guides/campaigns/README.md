# ðŸ“¤ Campaigns

Campaigns are a vehicle for raising a specific initiative for a project that you may or may not be a part of. It adds a minimum target, which is a time-based campaign that can refund funds if this goal is not met. This is great for knowing what you are raising, incentivizing the community to raise for an initiative, or if a funder wants to fund something conditionally, or to cancel an intiatiive if certain threshold funds are not met.&#x20;

Ex; Creating A Campaign to Fly to Korea for Korea Blockchain Week but cancel if don't get minimum $1000 USD to cover flight

* To encourage more people to raise funds for specific initiatives, we want everyone to be able to create a campaign, leveraging optional referrals
* To allow fans to start raising funds for their favorite projects
* To implement escrow-based fail-safes to guarantee that initiatives are not underfunded when minimum targets are not met

### Objectives

* Raising for a specific initiative
* Raising on behalf of an organization

Some case studies include:

* Up to this point, we only had rounds, which are more for foundations and grant programs
* Donations were just for projects and didn't specify campaigns
* There was no accountability for how funds would be used
* Donations were not time-based
* Outside of referrals, there was no way to raise funds for a specific cause
* Sometimes donations didn't amount to the intended goals

### Why

Campaigns are a way for people to set targets for specific initiatives and raise funds on behalf of organizations. They can also function as an escrow with minimum target amounts, refunding donors if the target is not met. Campaigns can be time-based. Currently, Potlock lacks a method for raising funds for favorite organizations and specifying initiatives. This feature allows everyday users to take ownership of how they contribute to raising funds for their organizations. Additionally, campaigns on behalf of organizations have an approval process to indicate whether a campaign is "official".



## Features

* Campaigns can only support 1 currency at a time
* Raise on behalf of an account
* Ability for a benficiary (someone who has a campaign raised on their half) to officially approve campaign
