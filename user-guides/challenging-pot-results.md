# ðŸ¥Š Challenging Pot Results

Considering quadratic funding rounds are based on humans, the actual calculations happen off chain, their could be room for collusion, we have built a process for anyone to issue on chain challenges during a cooldown period

A cooldown period starts after matching round when a [chef initiates it](chef-manual-or-run-a-qf-round-pot.md#cooldown-period) after processing off chain calculation and putting results on chain.

## Reason to Create A Challenge

* errors in bugs in the system: some donatiosn wer eblocked when originally created. Changes to nada bot requirements.&#x20;
* **a miscalculation in matched amounts**: show evidence of the miscalculation
* someone clearly paying people to donate and using unfair incentives to favor them in a round: show evidence of this> Example nada.bot evidence.&#x20;
* the chef/owner/admin doing some wrong doing: show evidence of the transaction and them clearly  initiating transaction that is different

## How to Create A Challenge



## Seeing Result of Challenge

Please go to the Potlock community chat to bring up new challenges that neeed to be addressed so this can be communicate to a chef. If a chef accepts a challenge, that means they need to provide a action for how this will change results. A chef must reject a challenge with a reason. In that case it will have no affect on outcome.&#x20;





After cooldown period is done and all challenges have been addressed a chef can either update results or intiaite payouts.
