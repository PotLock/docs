Once you add to cart you can click on cart then proceed to donate to then trigger a transaction.

The default amount for each item in the cart is 1 NEAR, you can change this by changing the amount.

Considering that cart is based on your computer's local storage, if you haven't logged in then you must login and have the minimum balance to cover the donation. **YOU MUST HAVE at least .1 NEAR to donate per project.**

If you want to get a better understand of fees, see which of the donations have a referrer fee and any gas / transaction fees per project donation, click on donation breakdown.&#x20;



After the donation, it should trigger a transaction, and clear the cart. You can view the transaction on nearblocks.io and use this for any tax purposes.&#x20;
