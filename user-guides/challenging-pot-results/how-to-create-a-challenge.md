1. Go to the Pot Page when the challenge period is active.
2. Click the "Challenge Payouts" button.
3. A popup will appear. Attach your main challenges and supporting evidence.
   * Preferred: On-chain documents with clear transaction data
   * Alternative: Traditional documents (ensure view-sharing is enabled)

## Seeing Result of Challenge

Please go to the Potlock community chat to bring up new challenges that need to be addressed so this can be communicate to a chef. If a chef accepts a challenge, that means they need to provide a action for how this will change results. A chef must reject a challenge with a reason. In that case it will have no affect on outcome.&#x20;

After cooldown period is done and all challenges have been addressed a chef can either update results or initiate payouts. A chef can flag paritcular donors



## Seeing Current Challenges

In the payouts tab of the Pot their will be a challenges drop down where you can see existing challenges.&#x20;

## For Chefs (Flagging Donors & Readjusting Payouts)

All calculations are calculated using quadratic funding, but a Chef can actual flag donors to be omitted from this calculation based on challenges, omit projects, and manually toggle the amount based on executive decisions. However any change to calculated payouts need to go through another payouts period.&#x20;
