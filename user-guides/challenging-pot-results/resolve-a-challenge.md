# ✅Resolve A Challenge

Resolving Challenges
{% endembed %}

In the challenge period of a quadratic funding round, participants can address discrepancies or issues related to payouts. Think of this process like a quality control check in a restaurant kitchen, where chefs ensure that every dish meets the standards before it leaves for the dining room. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

### **Understanding the Challenge Period**

The challenge period occurs after the matching period and before payouts are finalized. This typically lasts about a week, allowing stakeholders to raise concerns about the payout calculations—much like how a chef might review orders to catch any mistakes before serving.

### **Identifying Issues**

Challenges may arise from incorrect results, potential fraud (e.g., collusion among donors), or miscalculations in matched amounts. Stakeholders can submit challenges to have these issues reviewed, similar to how diners might flag an incorrectly prepared meal.

### **Resolving Challenges**

If you are an admin or chef, you can review and resolve challenges. This involves verifying claims and recalculating payouts as necessary. Just as a chef would taste a dish and adjust the seasoning, you need to ensure that all claims are accurate before moving forward. If challenges are not resolved, the payout process cannot proceed.

### **Initiating Payouts**

Once all challenges are addressed, the admin can initiate payouts by clicking the “process payouts” button. If there are unresolved challenges, this action will fail—like trying to serve a dish that hasn’t passed quality control.

### Finalizing Payouts

After successfully processing payouts, funds will be distributed to eligible projects based on the final calculations, much like serving perfectly prepared meals to satisfied customers.

### **Verification of Transactions**

After payouts are processed, it’s important to verify that transactions have been completed successfully by checking transaction records on NEAR blocks—similar to how a restaurant would confirm that all orders have been delivered correctly.

### **Conclusion**

The process concludes with successful payouts to projects, and stakeholders are encouraged to review any remaining issues for future rounds, ensuring that each new funding round is as smooth and successful as possible.

### Updates to Payout Dashboard

We've recently updated the payout dashboard with new features. It now allows for QF overrides and notes that post to NEAR Social. We've also added a judge weight feature, enabling overrides based on your results. Soon, we'll introduce a UI in round settings to better indicate the judge weight in advance. You'll be able to set percentages for calculating QF weights versus judge weights. For judge weights based on round manager consensus, you can split the pie according to pool relevance and your own metrics.
