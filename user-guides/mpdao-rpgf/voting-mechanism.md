# Voting Mechanism

### Overview of Voting Mechanism

In the RPGF Round #1, each participant's vote is not merely a single unit of influence; rather, it is amplified by specific criteria that users can meet to increase their voting weight. This mechanism ensures that contributions to the mpDAO ecosystem are recognized and rewarded fairly.

### Voting Weight Criteria

Voting weight is determined by several key factors, which serve as boosters to enhance the power of each vote. For every criterion you met automatically qualifies you for increased voting weight:

1. **Human Verification:**&#x20;

* Users who complete human verification through Nada.bot will receive a 10% boost to their voting weight.

2. **Governance Participation**:

* Users with at least 10,000 votes in mpDAO governance will receive an additional 25% boost.
* Users with 25,000 votes will receive another 25% boost, totaling a potential 50% increase from governance participation alone.

3. stNEAR Staking:

* Users who stake a minimum of 2 stNEAR in Meta Pool will gain a 10% boost.
* Those who stake 10 stNEAR will receive a 30% boost, leading to a total possible increase of 40% from staking.

By meeting all these criteria, users can achieve up to 100% vote weight, significantly enhancing their influence in the voting process.
