Referral links&#x20;

One of the best things about PotLock, is we are aligning incentives for citizens, and those helping grow the pot, by doing automatic on chain referrals + payouts. And its super easy. All you need to do is go to your favorite project page when you are logged in and click the share button.

When a project then goes through your link, the referred account in props will be added to project in local storage (you can see this on project breakdown).

Or if you are into tinkering and not logged in you can simply [https://near.social/potlock.near/widget/Index?tab=project\&projectId=magicbuild.near\&referrerId=potlock.near](https://near.social/potlock.near/widget/Index?tab=project\&projectId=magicbuild.near\&referrerId=potlock.near) replace potlock.near as the referredId in the props to the account of your choice&#x20;
