# ‚úè Create Guides

Create guides or provide user feedback. User feedback we prefer the most on Github if your are technically oriented, or directly on our BOS feedback board.&#x20;



For Guides, some pain points for users may be

* For projects to understand milestone process&#x20;
* Projects on creating application, and defining their milestones.&#x20;
* Projects understanding eligibility for certain Pots as Pot matures
* Year round donations.&#x20;
* For supporting to understand how quadratic funding works
* Advertising referral based opportunities
* Understanding attestation system and how project can benefits from this
* For Chefs to be in the cadence of regularly reviewing applications and milestones.&#x20;
* Understanding the terminology we use
* Patrons understanding how to throw down for funding round, to see their impact and proof of donations.&#x20;
