# Stakeholder Pages

It is important to note that people can be a collection of stakeholders.

Examples

* A Donor can also be a Patron by funding a round
* A Project can donate through that account
* A Project can be a Patron and also fund rounds

However it is reccommended that donor's dont KYC through their project account as this should reflect a named account under their individual identity. Additionally same goes for round managers aka Chefs. Chefs should also not be projects to prevent conflict of interests and could result in role getting revoke by ReFI Council.

Depending on the type of page information is render this way.



Their is also a all stakeholder page we are working on that

* Identifies what type of stakeholder by badge
* Renders those elements accordingly
