## Our Values

* Funding Public Goods
* Impact Based Assessment
* Bringing in New Channels of Capital
* Allowing Funding to Scale with Growth of Projects

### Origin Name

Potlucks are communal events where everyone brings their own dish to the table. As a funding platform we embody these values  Also sometimes referred to a PotLock. Additionally a community Pot is generally considered as a source of funding, while a lock invokes security and trust. At PotLock we embody all this, the community coming together with different resources to the table, to secure funding for the public.



## Current State of PotLock

Current we are in our beta phase and MVP2, with project registration + direct donations w/ referrals.

* **Project Registry & Profiles:** Public Goods can register their project and edit their profile. Check out Create Your project for more information
* **Add  Donations to Cart + Checkout:** Add projects to your cart, toggle donations in NEAR, and payout multiple donations.
* **Donation Referrals:** Share your favorite public good project, and get a fee everytime someone donates through your link. Automatic payouts in NEAR. Click here to see how to get a donation referral link.



### Current Fees (Direct Donations)

**Protocol Fee: 10%** paid out to impact.sputnik-dao.near to support development and expansion of potlock.

**Project Fee: 90-75%** (less if their is a referral fee): automatically paid out most of donation. Reason for higher donations is to grow the pot an incentivize supporters to share link and us to build features to bring new funding mechanisms for public goods.&#x20;

**Referral fee (optional)**: 15% given to those who share and promote projects. If someone donates through link than an automatic payout upon donating will be given to referred. For more information on how to refer go to&#x20;
