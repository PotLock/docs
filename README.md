### Origin Name

Potlucks are communal events where everyone brings their own dish to the table. As a funding platform we embody these values  Also sometimes referred to a PotLock. Additionally a community Pot is generally considered as a source of funding, while a lock invokes security and trust. At PotLock we embody all this, the community coming together with different resources to the table, to secure funding for the public.
